# Titanic Survivors: Machine Learning or Iceberg?

Come aboard the Titanic Survivors repository and take a deep dive into the world of machine learning. Explore the depths of the Titanic dataset, train logistic regression models, and test their survival instincts against the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Will your model sink or swim? Join us and find out!

## Overview

This project is an implementation of machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset used for this project contains information on 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic, including passenger demographics, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival outcomes.

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Model deployment

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment. The notebook contains all the necessary code and explanations to follow along with the project.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.787, a log loss of 0.47, and an AUC of 0.84. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation selected 8 features as the optimal set for the model.
